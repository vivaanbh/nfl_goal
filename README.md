Constructing an expected goals model for different field goals in the NFL using Logistic Regression. This model will help pick out top performers according to their expected value of a kick.

- Data: from the link (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statsbylopez)

**Step 1: Expected Field Goals**
  - summary stats and distributions,
  - logistic regression model for expected goals,
  - and interpretation.

**Step 2: Points above average**
  - creation of a variable that captures value above average, its distribution and plot vs distance.

**Step 3: Top 5s**
  - aggregate the data by players, and club all above-average shots.
  - top 5 by points above average overall, on a per-kick basis, and for long kicks (45+ yards).

**Step 4: Measuring Kicker Effectiveness**
  - a plot of value generated by kicker vs distance, and top kicker plot.

This project shows a step-by-step approach to creating a logistic regression model to predict the expected value of a kick, and in understanding how different players in the NFL generate value for their teams.
